From John's First Prototype: (Dec 12, 2022)
 - Arrow keys move cursor
 - Enter adds things
 - cmd+opt+shift+down -> extends event
 - cmd+shift+down -> move event
 - select text of event
 - drag to move events
 - drag+ctrl to push fluid events
 - "text mode" vs "event mode" (event mode is like the parent, think: cells in python notebook)
